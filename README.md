## Project Overview  

The goal of this project was to transform three untidy datasets and process them
in ways that were useful for downstream analysis.  The untidy data sources were 
selected from topics discussed by CUNY's DATA607 students. 
Our project team (Daniel Moscoe, Ethan Haley, and Sean Connin) identified the 
following datasets for tidying, cleaning, and analyzing, each pertaining to 
aspects of hurricane activity in the Atlantic and related impacts on 
New Orleans, LA throughout its history:

1) Wikipedia HTML Tables -– measures of hurricane activity, intensity, and damages since 1900
2) Excel Spreadsheets -– demographic changes in New Orleans attributed to Hurricane Katrina (2005)
3) GeoJSON Files -- for mapping surviving landmarks and homes of jazz musicians

The datasets identified by our team afforded us the opportunity to construct a 
body-of-work with thematic coherence while challenging us to acquire and prepare
data from different sources and in different forms, as a group.
